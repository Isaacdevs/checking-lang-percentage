# checking-lang-percentage
I wanted to know how github checks and allocates the percentage for different programming languages used in a repository.


### Tech stack
* Java openjdk
* Python 3.9.2

### How to run;
you need to have a java jdk and python installed.
* Run ```java Code.java``` to display the size of the Python (code.py)file.
* Run ```python code.py``` to display the size of the Java (Code.java)file.


### Conclusion
The initial presumtion was that github uses the number lines of code in each progam file. The conclusion is, Github uses the sizes of files in Bytes.
